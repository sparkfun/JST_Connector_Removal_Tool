[*SparkFun JST Battery Removal Tool (TOL-27923)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-jst-battery-removal-tool.html)

The SparkFun JST battery removal tool is a tool to remove a standard 2-pin JST-PH connector (2mm pitch) from its housing! Easily remove a LiPo battery's 2-pin JST-PH female connector using the JST battery removal tool! Save your fingertips from grabbing the connector when wiggling the connector out. Avoid accidentally pinching the wires when using needle nose pliers. Or save your wires from being cut when using a diagonal cutter. Simply slide the tool over the LiPo battery's JST female connector with one hand. With your other hand holding the male connector, pull the JST female connector away to disconnect the battery!

This tool also features a keychain hole at the top. Slide in a keychain ring to keep it with [other tools](https://www.sparkfun.com/u-fl-push-pull-tool.html) in your toolbox! Or even have it hanging on a metal shelf with a [small magnet](https://www.sparkfun.com/magnet-square-0-25.html)! The triangle blocks were adjusted for a loose tolerance but will grip the wings when disconnecting. You can slide the tool from the top or the bottom side. A wire channel was also added for the LiPo battery's wires should you decide to slide the tool in a downward fashion when removing the connector against a table.

This tool is great for users who to swap LiPo batteries for projects. Once the LiPo battery is disconnected, you will need to insert replacement a LiPo battery by hand. The JST battery removal tool is not intended to insert a JST female connector into the male connector. This tool will work for most board designs with the [JST male connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/jst-right-angle-connector-smd-2-pin-black.html) populated on the edge of a board. Certain boards that have the JST male connector port facing toward the inside of the board may have components that will cause an obstruction when using the tool. Connectors that are populated close to the JST connector may also be another obstruction when using the tool.

Note: This part was 3D printed so there might be some slight imperfections from printing.

Note: This tool was remixed from user [firia](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4554126/files)! The following changes were made:

* increase height of walls to easily print from a LulzBot 3D printer
* sweet logo of the SparkFun flame
* smaller keychain hole
* channel to guide the wire
* fillet hard corners and edges
* deboss SparkFun logo, name, and version number

Note: Thinking about printing your own? You may need to adjust the 3D models in this repository depending on the 3D printer that you use! For example, the orientation of the keychain hole may not be ideal to print and may need to be adjusted or removed.
